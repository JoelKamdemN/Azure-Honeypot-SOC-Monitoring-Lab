# Azure-Honeypot-SOC-Monitoring-Lab

## Objective

In this hands-on lab, we’ll deploy a high-interaction honeypot on a Microsoft Azure virtual machine, intentionally exposed to the internet to attract and analyze malicious activity. Using this custom setup, we’ll:

- Capture & Analyze Attacks – Monitor live intrusion attempts (brute force, exploits, scans) and log attacker TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

- Integrate Microsoft Sentinel – Configure Sentinel to ingest honeypot logs, detect threats in real time, and generate automated alerts.

- Simulate SOC Operations – Respond to alerts as a security analyst, triaging incidents and refining detection rules.

Goal: Build a defensive workflow—from attack visibility to automated response—mimicking real-world SOC environments.

"To defeat attackers, you must first understand them."

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application with Sentinel.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Expanding hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure's security infrastructure and services.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
